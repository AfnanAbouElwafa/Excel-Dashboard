I utilized the AdventureWorks dataset, which features transaction processing scenarios for a fictional bicycle manufacturer.
The primary objective was to develop dashboards that deliver comprehensive insights into sales and product-related information. 

KPIs:
1- Total Sales
2- Total Fright
3- Total Tax 
4- Orders Quantity
5- Total Sales per Category
6- Total Sales per Month
7- Orders Qty by Category
8- Sales by Territory Group
9- Tax Amount by Territory Group
10- Orders Qty per Month
